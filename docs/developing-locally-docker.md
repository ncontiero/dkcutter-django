# Getting Up and Running Locally With Docker

## Prerequisites

- Docker; if you don't have it yet, follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/#supported-platforms).
- Docker Compose; refer to the official documentation for the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- DKCutter; refer to the official GitHub repository of [DKCutter](https://github.com/ncontiero/dkcutter).

## Before Getting Started

Generate a new django project:

```bash
npx dkcutter@latest gh:ncontiero/dkcutter-django
```

For more information refer to [Project Generation Options](./project-generation-options.md).

## Build the Stack

This can take a while, especially the first time you run this particular command on your development system:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build
```

Generally, if you want to emulate production environment use `docker-compose.production.yml` instead. And this is true for any other actions you might need to perform: whenever a switch is required, just do it!

After we have created our initial image we need to generate a lockfile for our dependencies.
Docker cannot write to the host system during builds, so we have to run the command to generate the lockfile in the container.
This is important for reproducible builds and to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly in the container.
Updating the lockfile manually is normally not necessary when you add packages through `uv add <package_name>`.

This is done by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django uv lock
```

To be sure we are on the right track we need to build our image again:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build
```

## Run the Stack

This brings up both Django, PostgreSQL and PGAdmin. The first time it is run it might take a while to get started, but subsequent runs will occur quickly.

Open a terminal at the project root and run the following for local development:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

You can also set the environment variable `COMPOSE_FILE` pointing to `docker-compose.local.yml` like this:

```bash
export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.local.yml
```

And then run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To run in a detached (background) mode, just:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The site should start and be accessible at <http://localhost:3000> if you selected Rspack as frontend pipeline and <http://localhost:8000> otherwise.

## Execute Management Commands

As with any shell command that we wish to run in our container, this is done using the `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm` command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Here, `django` is the target service we are executing the commands against. Also, please note that the `docker exec` does not work for running management commands.

## Configuring the Environment

This is the excerpt from your project’s `docker-compose.local.yml`:

```yml
# ...

postgres:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: ./compose/production/postgres/Dockerfile
  volumes:
    - local_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    - local_postgres_data_backups:/backups
  env_file:
    - ./.envs/.local/.postgres
# ...
```

The most important thing for us here now is `env_file` section enlisting `./.envs/.local/.postgres`. Generally, the stack’s behavior is governed by a number of environment variables (env(s), for short) residing in `envs/`, for instance, this is what we generate for you:

```bash
.envs
├── .local
│   ├── .django
│   ├── .postgres
└── .production
    ├── .django
    └── .postgres
```

Consider the aforementioned `.envs/.local/.postgres`:

```env
# PostgreSQL
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=<your project slug>
POSTGRES_USER=49nKf38fzX92JGfHjgpX5UyAv5RZ6q
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=awWYmw3K9b5m7WT62wxFySQY6wkgy25u3zHVT7NWJyCN9unuFbov69cuiL2U
```

The three envs we are presented with here are `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (by the way, their values have also been generated for you). You might have figured out already where these definitions will end up; it’s all the same with `django` service container envs.

## Tips & Tricks

### Add 3rd party python packages

To install a new 3rd party python package, you cannot use `uv add <package_name>` (unless you're using Compose and/or volumes), that would only add the package to the container. The container is ephemeral, so that new library won’t be persisted if you run another container. Instead, you should modify the Docker image: You have to modify `pyproject.toml` and either add it to `project.dependencies` or to `tool.uv.dev-dependencies` by adding:

```txt
"<package_name>==<package_version>"
```

To get this change picked up, you’ll need to rebuild the image(s) and restart the running container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

### Debugging

#### django-debug-toolbar

In order for `django-debug-toolbar` to work designate your Docker Machine IP with `INTERNAL_IPS` in `config/settings/local.py`.

#### docker

The `container_name` from the yml file can be used to check on containers with docker commands, for example:

```bash
docker logs <project_slug>_local_celeryworker
docker top <project_slug>_local_celeryworker
```

Notice that the `container_name` is generated dynamically using your project slug as a prefix.

### Mailpit

When developing locally you can go with [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/) for email testing provided `use_mailpit` was set to `y` on setup. To proceed,

1. make sure `<project_slug>_local_mailpit` container is up and running;
2. open up <http://127.0.0.1:8025>.

### Celery tasks in local development

If you need tasks to be executed on the main thread during development set `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` in `config/settings/local.py`.

Possible uses could be for testing, or ease of profiling with DJDT.

### Celery Flower

[Flower](https://github.com/mher/flower) is a “real-time monitor and web admin for Celery distributed task queue”.

Prerequisites:

- `useCelery` was set on project initialization.

By default, it’s enabled both in local and production environments (`docker-compose.local.yml` and `docker-compose.production.yml` Docker Compose configs, respectively) through a `flower` service. For added security, `flower` requires its clients to provide authentication credentials specified as the corresponding environments’ `.envs/.local/.django` and `.envs/.production/.django` `CELERY_FLOWER_USER` and `CELERY_FLOWER_PASSWORD` environment variables. Check out <http://localhost:5555> and see for yourself.

### Using Rspack or Webpack

If you’ve opted for Rspack or Webpack as front-end pipeline, the project comes configured with live reloading. As you change your CSS/JS source files, the task runner will automatically rebuild the corresponding CSS and JS assets and reload them in your browser without refreshing the page.

The stack comes with a dedicated node service to build the static assets, watch for changes and proxy requests to the Django app with live reloading scripts injected in the response. For everything to work smoothly, you need to access the application at the port served by the node service, which is <http://localhost:3000> by default.

### Using Just for Docker Commands

We have included a `justfile` to simplify the use of frequent Docker commands for local development.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, "Just" does not reliably handle signals or forward them to its subprocesses. As a result, pressing CTRL+C (or sending other signals like SIGTERM, SIGINT, or SIGHUP) may only interrupt "Just" itself rather than its subprocesses. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/casey/just/issues/2473).

First, install Just using one of the methods described in the [official documentation](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html).

Here are the available commands:

- `just build` - Builds the Python image using the local Docker Compose file.

- `just up` - Starts the containers in detached mode and removes orphaned containers.

- `just down` - Stops the running containers.

- `just prune` - Stops and removes containers along with their volumes. You can optionally pass an argument with the service name to prune a single container.

- `just logs` - Shows container logs. You can optionally pass an argument with the service name to view logs for a specific service.

- `just manage <command>` - Runs Django management commands within the container. Replace `<command>` with any valid Django management command, such as `migrate`, `createsuperuser`, or `shell`.
